# Information

This repository contains the work on my 2.0 roleplay framework for FiveM. The contents are incomplete and shouldn't be expected to work out-of-the-box.

The following modules need to be built manually: chat, ui, inventory, and devices - which can be found in systems.

# Table of Contents
- [Conventions](docs/conventions.md)
- [Installation](docs/installation.md)
- [Resources](docs/resources.md)
	- [Entities](docs/entities.md): easily create persistent abstract objects; like for dynamic navigation menus.
	- [Interact](docs/interact.md): general purpose interface with the world.
	- [Jobs](docs/jobs.md): register jobs externally that allow characters to interact with.
	- [Navigation](docs/navigation.md): nested options within a navigation wheel.
	- [Npcs](docs/npcs.md): create stateful npcs with a series of functions and callbacks.
	- [Utility](docs/utils.md): a bunch of random helpers.
